MOMENTS TRIP PLANNER APP

### About
A full stack web trip planning application that enables users to plan for trips by adding dates and destinations and document trip encounters.

#### Author
### Sheillah Wangala


### Technology
~Ruby on rails for API
~React for frontend

### Getting Started
A user needs an electronic device either computer, phone or tablet, with an internet connection. Opening the web page, a user first encounters the home page that has general information about the application.
On signing in, a user is able to create a new trip and adddestinations to the trip. Trip and destination details could be added as well as deleted.

### Future developments
I look forward to intergrating with gps so that trip navigations can be given in real time.
